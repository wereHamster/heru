{"name":"Heru","body":"What is it?\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nHeru, in its heart, is a DSL to describe the state of a UNIX system. You\r\nspecify which files, user accounts, groups etc. should exist. If the system\r\ndoes not match the desired state, heru takes actions to correct that.\r\n\r\nIn that regard it's very similar to [puppet][puppet]. In fact, much of heru\r\nwas directly inspired by puppet. However, there are significant differences.\r\nThe most important is that heru aims to be standalone. The goal is to not have\r\nany external dependencies. Just drop it into a folder and you're ready to go.\r\nAlso, heru does not provide you with any infrastructure. You are expected to\r\nuse whatever tools you are already using to distribute the configuration\r\nfiles. These two things together make heru very small, lightweight and\r\nhopefully easier to configure.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nFirst you have to describe your hosts (nodes). Each node has its own file,\r\nand contains the network configuration and manifests which should be applied\r\nto it. A manifest is a collection of one or more resources which should be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nLet's take a closer look. A node description might look something like this:\r\n\r\n    exports.manifests = [\r\n      'sshd', 'mysql'\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThe `sshd` manifest might describe that the file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` needs\r\nto exist, have certain permissions and contents:\r\n\r\n    { Manifest, Action } = require 'heru'\r\n    class module.exports extends Manifest\r\n\r\n      'path:/etc/ssh/sshd_config': ->\r\n        type: 'file', mode: 0644, user: 'root', group: 'root', action: ->\r\n          Action.Render 'sshd_config'\r\n\r\nIf the file does not exist, heru will create it. The `Render` action takes the\r\n`sshd_config` template file and writes it to its correct location. There are\r\nother actions which you can use, and there are also cases where you don't have\r\nto specify an action.\r\n\r\nIf the syntax seems familiar to you, it's maybe because heru and all its\r\nconfiguration files are written in [Coffee-Script][coffee-script]. \r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I install it?\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nI recommend that you install heru into your `/root/.heru` folder, with the\r\nfollowing structure:\r\n\r\n    runtime/  - The heru runtime (clone this repo here)\r\n    library/  - Library with your manifests\r\n    nodes/    - Node descriptions\r\n\r\nThen you need to install [Node.js][nodejs] and [Coffee-Script][coffee-script].\r\nNode.js is fairly easy to compile (`./configure --without-ssl && make`). You\r\ncan clone Coffee-Script into a directory and then add its `bin/` folder to\r\nyour path. In due time there will be a fully automated install script.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like it, how do I help you?\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nThis project has its home on [GitHub][github].
